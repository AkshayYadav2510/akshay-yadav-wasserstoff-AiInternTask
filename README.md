# 🧠 AI Intern Task – Document Research & Theme Identification Chatbot
This project was built as part of an AI Internship Task at Wasserstoff Innovation & Learning Labs.

The chatbot enables users to upload PDFs or scanned documents, ask natural language questions, and receive smart, context-aware answers along with theme-based analysis — powered by GenAI models and vector search.

# 🚀 Features
📄 Upload and process PDFs or scanned images

🔍 Extract text using OCR and PDF parsing

🧩 Chunk and embed text using Sentence Transformers

🔎 Semantic search with FAISS

🤖 Question answering via Hugging Face LLM (FLAN-T5)

🧠 Automatically detect key themes across document chunks

💡 Compatible with free environments like Google Colab

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
Component	Tool / Library
Programming Language	Python 3.11

OCR Engine	Tesseract via pytesseract
PDF Parser	pdfplumber
Vector Embeddings	sentence-transformers (MiniLM)
Semantic Search	FAISS
LLM for QA / Themes	google/flan-t5-base

# 🧪 How It Works
Upload a PDF or image document

Extract text using OCR or PDF parsers

Split text into small overlapping chunks

Generate vector embeddings for each chunk

Use FAISS to find semantically similar chunks

Ask any question — get LLM-generated, context-rich answers

Automatically detect main themes from the document corpus

# ▶️ How to Run This
Open the notebook in Google Colab or a local Jupyter environment

Upload your documents (PDFs or images)

Ask questions like:
“What are the financial highlights in this report?”

Get instant answers with supporting themes and references
